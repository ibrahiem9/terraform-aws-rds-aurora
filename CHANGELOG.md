# Changelog

## 1.0.0 - 2025-02-11

- Forked the upstream module and removed all optional Aurora features, leaving only the resources required for a basic clustered deployment (subnet group, security group, cluster, writer instance, optional readers).
- Simplified the input surface to focus on core cluster configuration, networking, and lifecycle settings.
- Rewrote documentation and examples to match the minimal feature set.
